/**
 *  RTSMediaPlayerController is inspired by the MPMoviePlayerController class.
 *  A media player (of type RTSMediaPlayerController) manages the playback of a media from a file or a network stream. 
 *  You can incorporate a media playerâ€™s view into a view hierarchy owned by your app, or use a RTSMediaPlayerViewController
 *  object to manage the presentation for you.
 *
 *  The media player controller posts several notifications, see RTSMediaPlayerConstants.h
 *
 *  Errors are handled through the `RTSMediaPlayerPlaybackDidFailNotification` notification. There are two possible
 *  source of errors: either the error comes from the dataSource (see `RTSMediaPlayerControllerDataSource`) or from 
 *  the network (playback error).
 *
 *  The media player controller manages its overlays visibility. See the `overlayViews` property.
 *
 *  Methods related to playback can be found in the RTSMediaPlayback protocol
